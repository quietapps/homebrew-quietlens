  # Build is not signed with an Apple Developer ID. Make the app launchable on
  # any Mac out of the box:
  #   1. Strip ALL extended attributes (com.apple.quarantine, com.apple.macl,
  #      com.apple.provenance) so Gatekeeper does not block launch.
  #   2. Force-register the bundle with Launch Services so double-clicking from
  #      Finder / Dock launches the real binary.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Quiet Lens is currently distributed unsigned. The post-install hook
    strips Gatekeeper attributes automatically, but if the app refuses to
    launch on a fresh Mac, do this once:

      1. Open Finder → /Applications
      2. Right-click Quiet Lens.app → Open
      3. Click "Open" in the dialog
      4. macOS remembers your choice for every future launch

    Or run this in Terminal once after install:
      xattr -cr "/Applications/Quiet Lens.app"

    Quiet Lens needs Accessibility access to detect which window is focused.
    On first launch, grant access in:
      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility

    After upgrading, you may need to remove + re-add Quiet Lens in the
    Accessibility list because macOS binds permissions to the app's code
    signature, which changes between unsigned builds.
